## Demos

3 demos are available for different use-cases:

-   React implementation with a regular redirect (summary page on a separate URL), no overriding of customFunctions. The demo is located inside this project under `/demo`

-   React implementation for a single page application (replacing regular redirect with react-router-dom). The demo is located [here](https://github.com/optile/demo-express-checkout-react-spa)

-   UMD implementation with a regular redirect. The demo is located [here](https://github.com/optile/demo-express-checkout-redirect)

-   React regular redirect live demo - <https://optile.github.io/express-checkout/?env=integration>

### Express component modes

The component currently has two modes:

-   'Initial mode' (`mode === null`) is used for the stage or page in your shop where the 3rd party express buttons (such as "Checkout with PayPal" and similar) are shown to your customers. This can be, for example, on your cart page or on a single item details page.

-   'Summary mode' (`mode === "Summary"`) is used when the end-customer has already authenticated with the 3rd party provider, and a summary page with their cart contents, and any other information regarding the purchase is displayed before they finalise the order.

### How to style Express Checkout

The following two classes are the ones you should consider styling:

-   `payments-summary-confirm-button`: The 'Confirm' button rendered on the summary "page" can be styled using this class in your page's CSS.

-   `global-error`: In case of error, Express Checkout will render a global error component, which displays a message. This component is hidden by default, but you can set it to visible and style it using CSS

### More information about how to use ExpressCheckout Component

It is the main component to render express checkout widget

-   @param {Object} params it contains
    -   @param {Object} configuration like in the example, it contains (baseURL, clientId, country, language, translation and paymentMethodsConfiguration)
    -   @param {Function} createTransactionDetails is a function that will generate a transaction object used in createExpressPreset
    -   @param {Object} customFunctions are your implementations for certain scenarios such as when errors occur. For more information, see below.
    -   @param {String} mode indicates the mode of the component, default is `null`. See 'Express component modes' above.
    -   @param {String} longId required in `mode === "Summary"`. Is returned from a successful `updateExpressPreset` call.

### `server` folder in `demo`

The `server` folder in `demo` folder is named so, because all the service calls and constants defined in that folder are to be called or available in the server side of the merchant. That's why even the merchant user name and token are set in the `constants`. This just means that these values are available in the server side. Just for demo purpose we have showcased the server side calls here. Otherwise these have to be called in the server side of merchant, not in the client side.

### How to display shipping address and payment methods in `Summary` page

-   When you load summary page call `getExpressPreset` to fetch shipping address and payment details

-   It is a server side API so it has to be called from backend. It only needs `longId` which you already have

-   The response would have `customerCollectedDetails.addresses.shipping`, an object which contains the shipping address details

-   The response would have `network` which is the payment network used

-   The response would have `products` which is the purchased products details

-   You could use these details to display summary details in the summary page

### How to charge payment and check for the payment status in `Thankyou` page

-   When you load thank you page call `getExpressPreset` to fetch `charge` URL

-   It is a server side API so it has to be called from backend. It only needs `longId` which you already have

-   From `getExpressPreset` API you would get response which has `links.charge`. This could be used to call the `charge` request which will intiate the payment

-   On the success of charge request, in response you could check for `status.code`. If this value is "charged" your payment is successfull

-   You could use these details to decide what to be displayed on Thank you page. If its error case you could display some error message. If its success you could display the thank you message

    -   @param {String} network payment code, for example: "PAYPAL"
    -   @param {String} step it indicates the current step for example Update
    -   @param {Function} dispatch the dispatch function used in redux to modify the store, the actions structures should be known

<br/>
<br/>

##### dispatch parameter passed in most of customFunctions

The 'dispatch' parameter that exists in most of the customFunctions is the store's reducing function in Redux, please check [this link](https://redux.js.org/api/store/#dispatchaction) for more information. It is not the most recommended way to make changes in the component, but it may be needed in some cases and the action keys and structure should be known.

<br/>
<br/>

When calling the dispatch function, pass an object that contains a type (the key or name of the action) and a payload that represents the changes.

```javascript
var action = {
    type: "STORECONFIGURATION",
    payload: {
        baseURL: "",
        clientId: "",
        country: "",
        language: "",
        translation: [],
        paymentMethodsConfiguration: [],
    },
};
dispatch(action);
```

Available actions:

To store the configuration:

```javascript
{
    type: "STORECONFIGURATION",
    payload: {
        baseURL: "",
        clientId: "",
        country: "",
        language: "",
        translation: [],
        paymentMethodsConfiguration: []
    }
}
```

<br/>
<br/>

To store the widget mode:

```javascript
{
  type: "STOREMODE",
  payload: "Summary"
}
```

<br/>
<br/>

To store the longId:

```javascript
{
  type: "STORELONGID",
  payload: "12345678901234567890"
}
```

<br/>
<br/>

LISTLOADING (when set to `true`) represents the state of waiting for a LIST response. It can be set to `true` or `false` this way:

```javascript
{
  type: "LISTLOADING",
  payload: true
}
```

<br/>
<br/>

STORELIST is used to store the list of applicable networks as per the LIST response. Set it as per the following example:

```javascript
{
  type: "STORELIST",
  payload: [
    {
      code: "PAYPAL",
      label: "PayPal",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

<br/>
<br/>

PRESETACCOUNTLOADING (when set to `true`) represents the state of waiting for the response to pre-setting an account. It can be set to `true` or `false` this way:

```javascript
{
  type: "PRESETACCOUNTLOADING",
  payload: true
}
```

<br/>
<br/>

PRESETACCOUNT is used to store the preset account (typically the first step in Summary mode). Set it as per the following example:

```javascript
{
  type: "PRESETACCOUNT",
  payload: {
    links: {
      confirm: "",
      self: ""
    },
    resultInfo: "Pending; waiting for customer review and approval of payment details",
    interaction: {
      code: "PROCEED",
      reason: "TAKE_ACTION"
    },
    redirect: {
      url: "",
      method: "GET",
      parameters: [
      ],
      type: "SUMMARY"
    },
    network: "PAYPAL"
  }
}
```

<br/>
<br/>

STOREDISPLAYGLOBALERROR determines if the error component is loaded, and should be set to `true` when an error is encountered.

```javascript
{
  type: "STOREDISPLAYGLOBALERROR",
  payload: true
}
```

<br/>
<br/>

STOREGLOBALERROR allows storing an error text which is displayed in case STOREDISPLAYGLOBALERROR is set to `true`. Set it as per the following example:

```javascript
{
  type: "STOREGLOBALERROR",
  payload: "An Error happens"
}
```

  payload: true
}
```

<br/>
<br/>

CONFIRMACCOUNT is used to store the response from the backend that results from the confirmation call. Set it as per the following example:

```javascript
{
  type: "CONFIRMACCOUNT",
  payload: {
    links: {
      self: ""
    },
    resultInfo: "Approved; The payment is pending because it is part of an order that has been authorized but not settled; Merchant protection: None",
    interaction: {
      code: "PROCEED",
      reason: "OK"
    },

      url: "",
      method: "GET",

## Steps to run demo that present the component usage

`npm install`

`npm start`

Open <http://localhost:3000/>

There is a possibility to use Docker compose for development, and this will make sure that you are running to a similar environment as the server

First to build, listen to changes and run the container on port 3000

`docker-compose up`

To find the id of the freshly running container

`docker ps`

To run an interactive bash on this container replace IdOfContainer with the id of freshly running container then you have the possibility to run test or npm start to watch for changes as well Note: "exit" to get out of bash

`docker exec -it IdOfContainer sh`

## How to run Express Checkout build locally

-   `npm install`

-   `npm run onlybuild` - this creates the build in `build` and in `demo/dist` folders. Note that if you run `npm run build` that will trigger to publish in gh-pages

-   `npm run serve` - runs the build locally in the given port number in the serve script

-   open in browser http://localhost:3333

## How to publish Express Checkout in gh-pages

-   `npm run build`
